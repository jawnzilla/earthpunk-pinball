# Deadlight Critic Review — Pass 24

## Verdict

**Playable hackathon slice: PASS. AAA-ready: FAIL.** The current build now communicates a tighter run loop: map a descent, cradle a charged hinge, launch an imprinted ball into matching machinery, then choose either a route modifier or elemental hinge module. It is still a code-drawn prototype and needs another dedicated polish pass before it can credibly claim AAA.

## Findings

- **Gameplay clarity — PASS/WEAK:** The HUD now exposes route, score, progress, Stability, hinge attunements, and active imprints. Route choices are visible after each completed descent. The remaining weakness is that a player must discover the exact cradle geometry through play; a short animated first-use hint would improve onboarding.
- **Elemental loop — PASS:** Hinge cradling applies stacks, matching targets/generators/relays react, and route modifiers change gravity or launch kick. Fire, Water, Earth, and Air have distinct hooks, but the reactions still share a common feedback language.
- **Visual direction — WEAK:** The table has stronger depth planes, edge machinery, local glows, and impact rings. It remains primarily procedural Canvas geometry; authored silhouettes, animation language, and asset variety are not yet at AAA quality.
- **Mobile UX — PASS/WEAK:** Touch controls are dedicated, 48px minimum, keyboard-compatible, and responsive at narrow widths. The route/module list is information-dense on very short screens and needs a focused card carousel or two-step choice flow.
- **Physics/readability — WEAK:** Fixed-step physics and debug tuning remain useful. Real-device testing is still required for cradle timing, drain fairness, and route-modifier feel.
- **Delivery — PASS with evidence gap:** Hosted URL responds HTTP 200 and the static build is offline-safe. The browser harness was unavailable in one attempt because of a missing `oci` dependency; a later critic run did verify the hosted 320px layout with `scrollWidth === clientWidth`.

## Next-pass blockers

1. Add a first-run cradle tutorial that points at the hinge and demonstrates one charged imprint.
2. Split route selection from module selection on short mobile screens; do not force eight dense choices into one panel.
3. Give each elemental reaction a distinct animation/audio cue while preserving offline-safe assets.
4. Playtest on physical phones at 320/360/390 CSS widths and record screenshots plus touch interruption behavior.
5. Add one boss or threat table and one explicit resource/free-pass table so progression is not only a choice screen.

## Simplified changelog

- Added mobile command-deck HUD and touch-safe flipper buttons.
- Added elemental hinge charge/imprint state and reaction feedback.
- Added route modifier choices: Flooded Sluice, Ember Lift, and Bedrock Shortcut.
- Added route-specific gravity and flipper-kick modifiers.
- Deepened Canvas table rendering with machinery silhouettes, localized glows, and impact cues.
- Kept the build offline-safe with no CDN, remote fonts, fetch/XHR, or WebSocket dependencies.
- Pass 25: added FREE PASS / HAZARD / BOSS route identities and the Active kick tuning contract.
- Pass 26: split route risk and elemental module selection into a reversible two-step mobile flow.
- Pass 27: added the dedicated Blackout Core / Reactor Warden boss table with shield exposure, elemental damage gating, and visible HP pips.
- Pass 28: replaced the flat route list with a compact risk-coded route map and locked high-reward node.
- Pass 29: made route history persistent and Surface Vault a real Charge-gated reward branch.
- Physics pass: added four test presets and separated muted surface rebound from bumper rebound.
- Physics reach pass: added first-contact upward escape, repeat-kick lock, and live peak/launch telemetry.
