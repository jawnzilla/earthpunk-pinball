# Deadlight Build Log

## 2026-08-14 — Prototype 01: playable table slice

### Locked decisions

- Theme: Earthpunk underground society attempting to tunnel back to the surface.
- Genre target: Survival & Resource Management.
- Player fantasy: keep an excavation probe alive while mapping a route through buried infrastructure.
- Interaction: portrait pinball with touch flippers and keyboard fallback.
- Offline constraint: no external requests, remote fonts, CDN libraries, or hosted assets.
- First milestone: prove the physical table is satisfying before adding the roguelike upgrade layer.

### Implemented

- Responsive portrait Canvas table.
- Touch and keyboard flipper controls.
- Six salvage targets.
- Three generator bumpers.
- Charge and salvage meters.
- Stability-based loss condition.
- Surface-signal win condition.
- Reset flow.
- Earthpunk visual treatment using code-drawn shapes and system fonts.

### Verification notes

- Local browser verification is required before this entry is considered complete.
- Hosted GitHub Pages verification will be recorded after the first push and deployment.

### Next session

- Test touch controls on a real phone.
- Tune ball speed, drain forgiveness, and flipper response.
- Add the first between-stage upgrade choice.
- Add escalating hazards so the survival category is visible in the run, not only in the documentation.

## 2026-08-14 — Prototype 02: flipper feel and drain safety

### Locked decisions

- Flippers rest at a slight downward angle toward the outside edges.
- Flippers remain solid collision surfaces while idle.
- Activated flippers animate toward an upward striking angle.
- Post-collision ball speed is capped to keep returns playable.
- Side drain guards protect the ball from draining outside the flippers while preserving the center drain risk.

### Implemented

- Segment-based flipper collision instead of activation-only bounce zones.
- Animated flipper rotation with touch/keyboard activation feedback.
- Side guard rails with collision and visible rendering.
- Global ball velocity cap after bumper and flipper impacts.
- Pointer-capture fallback so non-standard pointer environments do not break input.

### Verification notes

- Clean local load renders the portrait table.
- Resting flippers visibly angle downward.
- Synthetic left activation visibly raises the left flipper.
- Reset and touch event path remain functional.
- Offline scan and `git diff --check` pass.

## 2026-08-14 — Prototype 03: core table read and flipper geometry

### Harsh review findings

- The previous flippers pointed outward, leaving an oversized center drain and failing the expected pinball read.
- The table read as a debug diagram rather than a physical machine because the hierarchy and action affordances were weak.
- The ball had no motion trail, making fast movement harder to read on mobile.

### Implemented

- Moved flipper pivots outward and tips inward to create a readable protected center lane.
- Kept the slight downward resting angle and upward activated angle.
- Added a restrained ball trail for motion readability.
- Added explicit in-table `LEFT FLIPPER` / `RIGHT FLIPPER` touch affordances that switch to `LIFT` while pressed.

### Verification notes

- Corrected endpoints now converge toward the center drain rather than the walls.
- `node --check` passes for the extracted game script.
- Offline-resource scan passes.
- `git diff --check` passes.
- Browser visual deployment review remains pending because the optional remote-debug browser harness is blocked by Chrome consent; do not treat this phase as AAA-complete.

## 2026-08-14 — Prototype 04: descent progression and run upgrades

### Harsh review findings

- The initial slice did not yet demonstrate the selected Survival & Resource Management genre strongly enough.
- A complete session needed within-run escalation and a meaningful decision point, not only a final win screen.

### Implemented

- Added a three-descent run structure.
- Added a between-descent upgrade choice with three materially different effects:
  - Reinforced bulkhead: increases maximum Stability and restores one point.
  - Tuned launch coil: raises the safe ball-speed ceiling.
  - Salvage magnet: increases Charge gained from targets.
- Added stage-aware HUD messaging and a deeper-descent transition.
- Added a real upgrade selection overlay with touch-friendly buttons.

### Verification notes

- `node --check` passes for the extracted game script.
- Offline-resource scan passes.
- `git diff --check` passes.
- Full browser playthrough and deployed visual review remain required before treating this phase as complete.

## 2026-08-14 — Prototype 05: fixed-step physics timing

### Harsh review finding

The original simulation advanced once per render frame. That made gravity, damping, flipper animation, collision response, and timers vary with device refresh rate.

### Implemented

- Added a fixed-step accumulator at 60 simulation steps per second.
- Capped catch-up work after long pauses to avoid a spiral of updates.
- Kept rendering independent from simulation cadence.

### Verification notes

- `node --check` passes for the extracted game script.
- Offline-resource scan passes.
- `git diff --check` passes.
- Cross-refresh-rate playtesting remains required on real devices.
