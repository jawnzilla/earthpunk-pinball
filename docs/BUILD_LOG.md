# Deadlight Build Log

## 2026-08-14 — Prototype 01: playable table slice

### Locked decisions

- Theme: Earthpunk underground society attempting to tunnel back to the surface.
- Genre target: Survival & Resource Management.
- Player fantasy: keep an excavation probe alive while mapping a route through buried infrastructure.
- Interaction: portrait pinball with touch flippers and keyboard fallback.
- Offline constraint: no external requests, remote fonts, CDN libraries, or hosted assets.
- First milestone: prove the physical table is satisfying before adding the roguelike upgrade layer.

### Implemented

- Responsive portrait Canvas table.
- Touch and keyboard flipper controls.
- Six salvage targets.
- Three generator bumpers.
- Charge and salvage meters.
- Stability-based loss condition.
- Surface-signal win condition.
- Reset flow.
- Earthpunk visual treatment using code-drawn shapes and system fonts.

### Verification notes

- Local browser verification is required before this entry is considered complete.
- Hosted GitHub Pages verification will be recorded after the first push and deployment.

### Next session

- Test touch controls on a real phone.
- Tune ball speed, drain forgiveness, and flipper response.
- Add the first between-stage upgrade choice.
- Add escalating hazards so the survival category is visible in the run, not only in the documentation.

## 2026-08-14 — Prototype 02: flipper feel and drain safety

### Locked decisions

- Flippers rest at a slight downward angle toward the outside edges.
- Flippers remain solid collision surfaces while idle.
- Activated flippers animate toward an upward striking angle.
- Post-collision ball speed is capped to keep returns playable.
- Side drain guards protect the ball from draining outside the flippers while preserving the center drain risk.

### Implemented

- Segment-based flipper collision instead of activation-only bounce zones.
- Animated flipper rotation with touch/keyboard activation feedback.
- Side guard rails with collision and visible rendering.
- Global ball velocity cap after bumper and flipper impacts.
- Pointer-capture fallback so non-standard pointer environments do not break input.

### Verification notes

- Clean local load renders the portrait table.
- Resting flippers visibly angle downward.
- Synthetic left activation visibly raises the left flipper.
- Reset and touch event path remain functional.
- Offline scan and `git diff --check` pass.
